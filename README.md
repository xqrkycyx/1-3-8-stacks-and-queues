# Stacks and queues

To succeed at this challenge, you'll need to demonstrate that you can do the following:

- Implement a stack and a queue.

> *Note: If downloading the assessment files to your local machine, make sure you're running Node v18 before you run* `npm install`.
>
> 1.  *Check which version you are running:* `node -v`
> 2.  *If needed, change the version to v18:* `nvm use v18`
>
> _For additional help, review the "Learn your tools: Visual Studio Code" lesson in the "Welcome" module._

## Instructions

Your goal for this assessment is to get the tests to pass.

To do so, you will be modifying the existing `Stack` and `Queue` classes to implement a stack and queue with insertion and deletion capabilities.

### Existing files

| File path      | Description                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/Stack.js` | Contains the definition of the `Stack` class. The `constructor()` method has already been completed for you. |
| `src/Queue.js` | Contains the definition of the `Queue` class. The `constructor()` method has already been completed for you. |

### Tasks

Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assessment. Just like in the lesson, you will use a linked list in your implementation.

In the `src/Stack.js` file:

1.  Complete the `push()` method to insert a node into the stack. The method should accept an argument `data` that represents the data to be stored in the node. Use the provided `_Node` class to create new node instances.

2.  Complete the `pop()` method to remove a node from a stack. The method should return the data stored in the deleted node.

In the `src/Queue.js` file:

1.  Complete the `enqueue()` method to insert a node into a queue. The method should accept an argument `data` that represents the data to be stored in the node. Use the provided `_Node` class to create new node instances.

2.  Complete the `dequeue()` method to remove a node from a queue. The method should return the data stored in the deleted node. If the queue is already empty, then the method should return `undefined`.

Once these tasks are complete, all tests should pass.
